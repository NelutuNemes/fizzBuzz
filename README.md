## FizzBuzz Collection

This repository comprises a collection of FizzBuzz applications, each implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Various approaches are explored to generate the classic FizzBuzz sequence based on user input.

Each approach is organized in a separate folder, and each folder contains a README file with specific information for that version:

Version 1 - [FizzBuzz Version 1 README](FizzBuzz-Version1/README.md)

Version 2 -[FizzBuzz Version 2 README](FizzBuzz-Version2/README.md)

# How to Use

Open the index.html file from each version in a web browser.
Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.
Press the "Enter" key or click the "Start FizzBuzz Function Test" button.
The FizzBuzz sequence will be displayed in the interface.
Optionally, click the "Reset" button to clear the sequence.

# Notes

Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in the browser for the proper functioning of the FizzBuzz Apps.
